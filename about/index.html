 <p>Zia is a <a href="https://sparkscratch-p.github.io/">SPARK</a> Product, designed, programmed, and coded by <a href="https://sparkscratch-p.github.io/">SparkScratch-P</a>.</p>
<p>Zia is able to create Scalable Vector Graphics, that one can use for creating eye-catching logos, game sprites, posters, thumbnails, icons, and what not! You can convert your graphics among Vector and Bitmaps, group and ungroup parts of an image, and most importantly, can import your pictures, or create and export as SVGs.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-the-zia-outputs-have-that-blows-your-mind-">What do the Zia outputs have that blows your mind?</h1>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong> – Vector images are resolution-independent and can scale to any dimension without losing quality. Browsers just recalculate the math behind the image so there is no distortion. Raster images on the other hand lose their resolution when enlarged because their small pixels are forced to expand beyond their original size.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interactivity</strong> – Hyperlinks and virtually any kind of animation can be added via styling and scripting.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easily editable</strong> – Editing an SVG is as easy as changing the coordinates or a word in a text editor or coding the SVG onto your webpage and altering it with JavaScript or CSS. You can also use popular vector graphics editing software such as Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, and Sketch.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Compact file-size</strong> – Pixel-based images are saved at a large size from the start because you can only retain the quality when you make the image smaller, but not when you make it larger. This can impact a site’s download speed. Since SVGs are scalable, they can be saved at a minimal file size.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SEO friendly</strong> – SVG images are defined in XML text files, so keywords and descriptions can be used and more easily recognized by search engines. With raster images, you are limited to the title or alt attribute of your file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As the quality of displays continues to increase on our devices, so must the images that we see. Although raster remains the preferred choice for photographs (because of their deep color depth), SVGs are ideal for illustrations like logos, icons, and graphs. Their infinite scalability makes them aesthetically pleasing, especially on platforms that provide an <strong><em>infinite digital canvas</em></strong> to work on.</p>
<h1 id="why-only-zia-">Why Only Zia?</h1>
<p> Zia is made on Javasciprt.  It is thus very smooth and lightweight, consumes the least bandwidth, and loads very fast! By record, it takes around 9.5 secs to load, even when the network bandwidth is less than 1 Mb/s; and loads within a second when it crosses 10 Mb/s- Damn fast! It consumes the least CPU usage and is lighter than any other Vector editor on the internet.</p>
